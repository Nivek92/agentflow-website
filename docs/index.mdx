# Quickstart

AgentFlow is a lightweight, event-driven framework designed for building and managing multi-agent systems.

In this short guide you'll learn everything you need to know to get started quickly.

## Core Components

Before we dive into specifics, lets first understand the core components in AgentFlow:

**Event**: Events are data transfer objects that define the information sent between different *actors*.

**Actor**: Actors are triggered by *events*. They can be simple functions or complex agents. 

**Event Emitter**: Event Emitters manage event listeners and broadcast events to them.

## Installation

To use AgentFlow, we first need to install it. 

To install AgentFlow run:

<CodeBlock language="python">pip install agentflow</CodeBlock>

## Your First Scenario

Let's walk through a simple example that teaches you how to use AgentFlow. By the end, you'll have a basic understanding of how you can use AgentFlow to create your own multi-agent systems.

### Step 1: Create The Events

Let's start by creating the events that will be send to and from the actor.

First we create the SumRequestEvent which we will use to trigger the actor and pass it our input values. 

```
  class SumRequestEvent(AbstractEvent):
    name: str = "sum_request_event"
    description: str ="Request the sum of numbers"

    a: int
    b: int
```

Next we create the SumResponseEvent which we will use to get the result back from the actor. 

```
  class SumResponseEvent(AbstractEvent):
    name: str = "sum_response_event"
    description: str ="Result of an addition"

    sum: int
```

### Step 2: Create The Actor

Now we create the SumActor that will take two numbers and calculate their sum.

```
  class SumActor(AbstractActor):
    name: str = "sum_actor"
    trigger_event: Type[AbstractEvent] = SumRequestEvent

    def _handle_event(self, event: SumRequestEvent):
      # Extract numbers from the event payload
      result = event.a + event.b
      
      # Create and emit a response event
      response_event = SumResponseEvent(sum=result)
      self._event_emitter.emit(response_event)
```

As you can see, we give it a name and define the event it will listen to. Inside the _handle_event method we then implement the logic to process the event and return the final result.
While in this example the logic is deterministic, not using an LLM, this is where you can design whatever you like.
You can emit new events to trigger other more complex actors, process their responses and then return the final result.

### Step 3: Put everything together

Now that we have our events and actor define, we can put everything together.

All we have to do now is create an *EventEmitter*, create an instance of our *Actor* and inject the *EventEmitter*.
Then we are ready to emit the *SumRequestEvent* to trigger our *Actor*.

```
with EventEmitter() as event_emitter:
  sum_actor = SumActor(event_emitter=event_emitter)
  event_emitter.emit(SumRequestEvent(a=4, b=8))
```

Now you might wonder, why nothing happens.
To change that let's register a basic logger that comes with AgentFlow printing all events and a function that prints the final result.


```
def return_response_to_user(event: SumResponseEvent):
	print(event.sum)

with EventEmitter() as event_emitter:
	event_emitter.on_all(Logger.log_event)
	event_emitter.on(SumResponseEvent, return_response_to_user)

	sum_actor = SumActor(event_emitter=event_emitter)
	event_emitter.emit(SumRequestEvent(a=4, b=8))
```

## Delve Deeper
That's it. You just built your first scenario using AgentFlow. As you can see AgentFlow is extremely simple to use.
